CART

muses_cart table for cart data


addresses table for address and shipping data


payment table for preferred payment info?


stripe_customers table to store which users have stripe accounts
I could instead make this one a payment information table
	stripe_info
	paypal_info
	bitcoin_info
	billing_address_info
	default_billing_address for each payment method?
