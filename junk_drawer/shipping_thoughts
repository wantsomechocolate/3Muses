The controller

The controller blindly sends over all of the addresses including default status


The View

the view checks to see if an address is the default address, if it is it checks the radio box
It should also add the selected class to the div I think. 

AJAX

The ajax should trigger a click on the selected div. The logic should say, if there is nothing there
or if 'change' is true
