DB changes need to be propegated to this page.  


Pay
Stopped working due to some db changes.
It's most likely related to the function I'm making to handle putting purchase info in the db. 

Add functionality to handle someone cancelling a paypal payment. ("I'm thinking I just bring them back to the cart page")





Login Page
No error when incorrect credentials are entered. Just page refresh.

When a gimp user is created, web2py allows me to change the email of the user to one that already exists in the database. This should not be allowed to happen. I need to put something in place that tells the user they need to choose a different email address. 

View Purchase History Page
This page no longer works because of db changes. 
I want to keep the default bread crumb functionality so I will keep some api responses in here
I'm thinking that the user can click on a link to see specific stripe, shipping, paypal information that opens up a modal. 


Profile Page
Does not reliably accept edits to information complaining that the email address is already in use. l


Misc.
Make a function for adding purchase info to the database since it is done in two different controller functions
