	Fine for now - consider adding header to category section

Product Page

Cart Page
	Proceeding to Checkout
	User is able to click Proceed to Checkout button before selecting a shipping option. 

Checkout page
	Add modal that activates after succesful form submission when paying with stripe - this requires custom stripe integration. 
	Make sure that Bitcoin works in test mode. Have to check what goes in DB, confirmation email, and view_purchase_history

	Bitcoin payment method is not working.

	Consider wrapping entire stripe callback function in a try block that catches errors and redirects the user instead of just producing "Server Error"


Confirmation page
	Add session variable that dictates wether or not the user is shown the register pane on the confirmation screen


Payments

	Paypal

		Cancelling payment

			Add functionality to handle someone cancelling a paypal payment. ("I'm thinking I just bring them back to the cart page") - yes this is fine for now. I checked and it does go to the cart page - I'll add a message, should be easy because paypal sends users back with a token. So for now I'll just check if there is a var named token and flash something that says you cancelled your payment on paypal - or I can just add something at the top of the page?





Login Page


View Purchase History Page

	I'm thinking that the user can click on a link to see specific stripe, shipping, paypal information that opens up a modal. 


Profile Page
Test ability to edit profile info for users that register normally and users that signed up after purchase. 






Checkout Flow

At first the cart page only shows the cart, then there is a button to add shipping information
Once an address is added, it becomes visible! more than one address can be added/selected?

Once an address is chosen, shipping information becomes visible, for a given address the shipping information is stored in session to limit calls to the shipping API EVEN THOUGH IT HAS MY FUCKING KEYS IN IT. 

Once a shipping method is chosen, the true final amount is given and can then be charged.

When session expires on the confirmation screen a refresh causes an error, because the session variable for the allowable confirmation page is gone. fix?





Registering at the end of purchase






Random Problems
Weird error that caused cart db rows with no associated user to put "in-cart" ribbons on products for non-users?
It would say it was in the cart, the button to add/remove said remove, but clicking on the cart page didn't let the user in because they weren't a guest yet.

TO GET SHIPPING BACK ON TRACK

Change session shipping info items to have both the delivery days, the delivery date, the service name as it comes from easypost and the service name that was converted to a human readable form. 

Change javascript so that it takes the delivery date and just puts where it goes, no error checking or formatting with js. If a delivery date can't be found server side, it will supply an N/A to put there instead. 

Add delivery date to the things to save in the purchase history
As well as the time of purchase. 
Make sure it is added while using the postgres db. 

If N/A is not desireable, it can be replaced later, or a tooltip can be added to it. 



async being set to false was starting to be unacceptable. I changed it to true, but now the address click for the default address is not getting clicked. I need to figure out a way to get around this without setting async false. 

Also add loading things and what not. 


Add a redirect to the sign up button that auto scrolls to the account pane. 

change flash message from profile updated after sign up

hide sign up pane after signup - use session variable

Ajax isn't updating the total cost after a different address is chosen. like wtf man.
