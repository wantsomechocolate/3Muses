Stopped working due to some db changes.
It's most likely related to the function I'm making to handle putting purchase info in the db. 

Add functionality to handle someone cancelling a paypal paymnet. ("I'm thinking I just bring them back to the cart page")





Login Page
No error when incorrect credentials are entered. Just page refresh.

View Purchase History Page
This page no longer works because of db changes. 
I want to keep the default bread crumb functionality so I will keep some api responses in here
I'm thinking that the user can click on a link to see specific stripe, shipping, paypal information that opens up a modal. 



Misc.
Make a function for adding purchase info to the database since it is done in two different controller functions
