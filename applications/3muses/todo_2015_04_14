Checkout page
There is absolutely no formatting or cosmetics on this page at all right now. - there is some now



Confirmation page
There is absolutely no formatting or cosmetics on thei page at all right now.
DB changes need to be propegated to this page. - done?


Pay
Stopped working due to some db changes.
It's most likely related to the function I'm making to handle putting purchase info in the db. 

Add functionality to handle someone cancelling a paypal payment. ("I'm thinking I just bring them back to the cart page") - yes this is fine for now. I checked and it does go to the cart page - I'll add a message, should be easy because paypal sends users back with a token. So for now I'll just check if there is a var named token and flash something that says you cancelled your payment on paypal - or I can just add something at the top of the page?





Login Page
No error when incorrect credentials are entered. Just page refresh. - big priority

When a gimp user is created, web2py allows me to change the email of the user to one that already exists in the database. This should not be allowed to happen. I need to put something in place that tells the user they need to choose a different email address. 

View Purchase History Page
This page no longer works because of db changes. 
I want to keep the default bread crumb functionality so I will keep some api responses in here
I'm thinking that the user can click on a link to see specific stripe, shipping, paypal information that opens up a modal. 


Profile Page
Does not reliably accept edits to information complaining that the email address is already in use.


Misc.
Make a function for adding purchase info to the database since it is done in two different controller functions - done I believe




Checkout Flow

Show the cart contents and total cart cost on one page
User can enter minimum shipping information and choose a shipping method to get shipping costs and a total cost
All on the cart page?

A new page is used for checkout purposes
If the user wants to pay with a card they must enter shipping information first, followed by billing information

If they want to pay with paypal they don't have to enter any further information, but what happens if the minimum shipping info they entered earlier doesn't match the shipping address they picked in paypal? At that point I have already authorized the charge for a given amount. Maybe I just keep it the way it is for now.

I GOT IT!

At first the cart page only shows the cart, then there is a button to add shipping information
Once an address is added, it becomes visible! more than one address can be added/selected?

Once an address is chosen, shipping information becomes visible, for a given address the shipping information is stored in session to limit calls to the shipping API EVEN THOUGH IT HAS MY FUCKING KEYS IN IT. 

Once a shipping method is chosen, the true final amount is given and can then be charged.

Two Choices
Have the option to choose a payment method pop up, if they choose paypal, then they can complete checkout np,
if they choose to pay with a card, they enter the information in a secure looking model letting them know that the info is not saved on threemusesglass.com servers. 

How would this work on mobile?
On mobile everything should be a new page?  :/





For the shipping charges, if someone adds an address and then adds a new item, the shipping rate isn't retrieved again! So I need to check to see if the address last modified time OR the cart last modified time is more recent than the shipping rates time associated with the address. 

I now have a time associated with adding an item to a cart. I also realized that I should not delete items from a cart, just deactivate them, so that later we can send customized emails to people that put something in their cart, but removed it. 

so anyway....

I have a time for each item in the cart
I have a time for the last time the address was added or edited
I have a time for the last time the shipping options were retrieved.

Everytime the shipping info is being generated, I need to check that the time that the shipping info was requested is always newer than

the most recent address time
the newest addition to the cart
24 hours before the current time





Checkout is to be moved to a different page than the cart and shipping information. Do that. 




Stripe is allowing two cards with the exact same credentials to be created.
I'm also allowing it. I should not do that. 


Deleting the last card on the checkout page doesn't put an error message :/


Create a card, create card with same stuff, delete one of them, try to proceed to payment screen.


Pressing back after entering card info brings you back to the payment info screen with data still entered. Change form to a modal popup and send data to stripe via ajax so the user can't press back and get to the screen. But still refresh afterwards because I can't handle so many ajax shit


Entering a card doesn't auto select after coming back to checkout screen - fix that ish. 


When session expires on the confirmation screen a refresh causes an error, because the session variable for the allowable confirmation page is gone. fix?


When there are multiple addresses
