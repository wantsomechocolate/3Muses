## OK NEW PLAN!
## I will store the entire dictionary for either payment method as serialzed dictionaries. 
## That way I have all the data I could ever want!
## I will pull out only those fields to store seperately that I consider to be important, or that I need often?
## And I will have helper functions for getting the desired data out of each dictionary for whatever application
## (emails, confimation screens, etc?)


## Fields for if the user is logged in
## None if that are not logged in. 
	Field('muses_id'),
	Field('muses_email_address'),
	Field('muses_name'),


## Session Fields (These actually come from response not session)
## These will be available for all users!
	Field('session_id_3muses'),
	Field('session_db_table'),
	Field('session_db_record_id'),

## Address for Shipping Fields, required for all users
	Field('shipping_name_first')
	Field('shipping_name_last')
	Field('shipping_street_address_line_1'),
	Field('shipping_street_address_line_2'),
	Field('shipping_municipality'),
	Field('shipping_administrative_area'),
	Field('shipping_postal_code'),
	Field('shipping_country'),

## Easypost Fields? Can I get address info from easypost?
## Can I get timestamps from easypost
## Should I serialize the easypost stuff as well?
	Field('easypost_shipping_service'),
	Field('easypost_shipping_carrier'),
	Field('easypost_rate_id'),
	Field('easypost_shipment_id'),
	Field('easypost_rate'),

## Payment Fields
	## Right now the payment methods are stripe vs paypal
	Field('payment_service'),

	## This field will be a serialized json object of the api response that confirms payment. 
	## That way I don't have to pick what I collect and I can alter what I do with the data at any time. 
	## I may want to store some other common data at a higher level, but I can choose to do that
	## at any time as long as I have this field. 
	Field('payment_dictionary'),

	## I'll keep a couple of the following fields for legacy purposes so shit doesn't break while I am 
	## converting over to the serialized version.
		
			# ## can be credit_card or paypal if paypal
			# ## can be credit_card if stripe, unless stripe unleashes it's paypal potential
			# Field('payment_method'),

			# ## name field used for payment, does not need to match user name or shipping name
			# Field('payment_name'),
			
			# ## This field exists for both stripe and paypal
			# Field('payment_payer_id'),
				
			# ## Both, but will usually be blank for paypal(not using a card)
			# Field('payment_credit_card_last_4'),
			# Field('payment_credit_card_brand'),
			# Field('payment_credit_card_exp_month'),
			# Field('payment_credit_card_exp_year'),

			# Field('payment_stripe_card_id'),
			# Field('payment_stripe_transaction_id'),


## Billing address information
	Field('billing_first_name'),
	Field('billing_last_name'),
	Field('billing_street_line_1'),
	Field('billing_street_line_2'),
	Field('billing_municipality'),
	Field('billing_administrative_area'),
	Field('billing_postal_code'),
	Field('billing_country_code'),
